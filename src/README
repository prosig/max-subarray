Application notes:

* Purpose: To find the sub-matrix with maximum sum given a square matrix
* Algorithm: Based on the O(n^3) Kandane's algorithm described here: http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/UVa_108
* Implementation is sequential and is based on comments from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2643908/getting-the-submatrix-with-maximum-sum

Software:

- Source code is in max-sub-array-vla.c
- Three input files are provided: test_input_0[0-2].in
- A Makefile is provided for compilation and testing

How to run:

- Type 'make' to compile 
- Type 'make run_test' to test
- Change the Makefile to test with different inputs
